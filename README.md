## Arduino-Gyroscope-LED-Control-Project

This project uses an Arduino microcontroller and a gyroscope sensor to control an LED light. When the gyroscope moves to the right, the LED light will glow, and when it moves to the left, the LED light will turn off.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need the following components:


Arduino microcontroller

Gyroscope sensor

LED light

Breadboard

Jumper wires


Once you have gathered all of the necessary components, you can start building your circuit. Connect the gyroscope sensor and LED light to the Arduino using the jumper wires and breadboard.


Installing the Code

Next, you will need to install the code on your Arduino microcontroller. The code for this project is available in the code.ino file. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the code to your microcontroller.


Testing the Project

With the code uploaded to the microcontroller, you can now test the project. Move the gyroscope to the right, and the LED light should glow. Move the gyroscope to the left, and the LED light should turn off.
